Hey Connections, oláá..(Hello)! 👋🙋‍♂️
Hope you're all doing great! 💝🥰

🚀 I'm excited to share that I’ve developed a Chrome Extension called ClickGuard.AI — Your Real-Time Phishing & Malicious Link Defender! 🛡️🔒

🔧 What is ClickGuard.AI?
ClickGuard.AI is a smart Chrome extension that safeguards users from phishing and malicious links using cutting-edge AI technology.
It intercepts every link click, analyzes the URL in real-time with a trained AI model, and:

→ If safe ➜ allows you to proceed
→ If risky ➜ blocks or warns you about potential threats

✨ Key Features:

  • Real-time scanning of every URL you click 🔍

  • AI-powered detection of phishing & malicious links 🤖

  • Automatic blocking of harmful links & alerts for suspicious ones 🚫⚠️

  • Whitelist manager for trusted domains ✅

  • Sleek, professional UI with intuitive controls 🎮

  • Local storage for settings and threat logs 📂

  • Smooth installation & integration with Chrome 🛠️

💡 Behind the Scenes:

  • AI model trained on phishing datasets (PhishTank + Logistic Regression) 📊

  • Flask backend to serve AI predictions in real-time ⚡

  • Chrome extension with a background service worker for live URL interception 🔄

  • Popup UI for settings, threat logs, and custom URL analysis 🖥️

This project brings together AI + Cybersecurity + Web Tech to create a powerful defense system against modern online threats. I'm proud to contribute to a safer browsing experience for everyone! 🌐🛡️

🔥 I’ve learned a lot during the development of ClickGuard.AI — and I know there’s still so much more to improve. But for now, I’m thrilled to share this innovation with you all!

Thank you for your time — see you soon! 🥰💝
